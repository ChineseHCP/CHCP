function comp = ft_datatype_comp(comp, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_COMP describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for comp data
%
% The comp data structure represents time-series channel-level data that has
% been decomposed or unmixed from the channel level into its components or
% "blind sources", for example using ICA (independent component analysis) or
% PCA. This data structure is usually generated with the FT_COMPONENTANALYSIS
% function.
%
% An example of a comp data structure with 100 components that resulted from
% a 151-channel MEG recording is shown here:
%
%          time: {1x10 cell}
%         trial: {1x10 cell}
%      unmixing: [100x151 double]
%          topo: [151x100 double]
%     topolabel: {151x1 cell}
%         label: {100x1 cell}
%       fsample: 300
%           cfg: [1x1 struct]
%
% The only difference to the raw data structure is that the comp structure
% contains the additional fields unmixing, topo and topolabel. See
% FT_DATATYPE_RAW for further details.
%
% Required fields:
%   - time, trial, label, topo, unmixing
%
% Optional fields:
%   - sampleinfo, trialinfo, grad, elec, hdr, cfg
%
% Deprecated fields:
%   - fsample
%
% Obsoleted fields:
%   - offset
%
% Revision history:
% (2011/latest) The unmixing matrix has been added to the component data
% structure.
%
% (2003) The initial version was defined
%
