function optim1
% Full multigrid matrix solver stuff (circulant boundaries)
%
% This is an old function, that is mostly not used any more.  It is
% retained for didactic purposes, because the C code may be easier to
% understand than that of optimN.  It does pretty much the same as
% optimN, but assumes that n4=1.
